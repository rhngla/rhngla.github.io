The following papers decribe the coupled autoencoder model [1], and its application to a patch-seq dataset of inhibitory cells:
- [2019 Gala et al.](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9125-a-coupled-autoencoder-approach-for-multi-modal-analysis-of-cell-types): A coupled autoencoder approach for multi-modal analysis of cell types 
 - [2020 Gala et al. (in press)](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7itda0g8c4p2135/2020_Gala_Revised.pdf?dl=0): Consistent cross-modal identification of cortical neurons with coupled autoencoders. An earlier version of this manuscript is available on Bioarxiv. 
 
 The patch-seq dataset is available here: [https://portal.brain-map.org](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/multimodal-characterization) and described in [Gouwens N., Sorensen S. et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X)

A version of the coupled autoencoder model and data are available in an interactive environment on [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/6320801/tree/v1)
