### References

The following papers decribe the coupled autoencoder model [1], and its application to a patch-seq dataset of inhibitory cells [2]:

**Patch-seq dataset**

 The dataset with inhbitory cells is described in [Gouwens N, Sorensen S. et al. (2020)]((https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S009286742031254X)). Head over to [https://portal.brain-map.org](https://portal.brain-map.org/explore/classes/multimodal-characterization) to interact with the data. 

**Code availability**
A version of the coupled autoencoder model and data are available in an interactive environment on [Code Ocean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/6320801/tree/v1).
