## About
<img align='right' height='200' width='200' src="./assets/Rohan.png"/>

I am a research scientist in the Informatics and Data Science group at the [Allen Institute](https://www.alleninstitute.org/). I develop computational methods to analyze multimodal datasets, with the aim of understanding the diversity and inter-relationships of cell types in the brain. 

I obtained a Ph.D. from [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), where I was advised by [Armen Stepanyants](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=l8csv_wAAAAJ&) as part of the [Neurogeometry lab](http://www.northeastern.edu/neurogeometry/). As part of my thesis, I developed computational tools [NCTracer](http://www.northeastern.edu/neurogeometry/resources/tools/) and [BoutonAnalyzer](https://github.com/neurogeometry/BoutonAnalyzer) to quantify neuronal structures from light microscopy images. I also worked on theoretical models of associative learning aimed at explaining statistical features of connectivity in the cortex. Prior to that, I obtained a B.Tech. & M.Tech. in Engineering Physics from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).

## Research 
I'm broadly interested in representation learning, computer vision, and statistical mechanics. Currently, I'm working on developing non-linear dimensionality reduction methods to evaluate correspondence across different data modalities, aimed at establishing consistent cell type taxonomies.
