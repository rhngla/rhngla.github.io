I am a research scientist in Uygar Sümbül's group at the [Allen Institute](https://www.alleninstitute.org/). I work on the development of computational methods to analyze multimodal datasets, aimed towards understanding the diversity and inter-relationships of cell types in the brain. Previously, I obtained a Ph.D. in Physics from [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu/), and completed a B.Tech & M.Tech in Engineering Physics at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/).
